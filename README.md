# BlahST
**Blah** **S**peech-to-**T**ext will let you have a bla(h)st pasting text from speech on Linux, with keyboard shortcuts and whisper.cpp. Fire up your microphone and input text the AI way.

The inspiration for this little tool for Linux came from [Blurt](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/blurt/) - a simple GNOME extension that can input text from speech into any window with an editable text field.
If you liked Blurt for its high power and simplicity, you will love this. 

**BlahST is probably the leanest Whisper-based speech-to-text input tool for Linux, sitting on top of the lean and mean whisper.cpp. Now with the option to send audio to a whisper.cpp server for network [transcription.](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/BlahST/#network-transcription)**

The work is, again, done by the *wsi* script, which is a toned-down version of [NoteWhispers](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/notewhispers/).
The actuall heavy lifting is performed by whisper.cpp which must be precompiled on your Linux system as described in [Blurt](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/blurt/) or available as a [server](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/examples/server) instance on your LAN.
The idea here is to not even write an extension like Blurt. Just use a pair of hotkeys to start and stop recording from the microphone and send the recorded speech to whisper.cpp

When speech input is initiated, a microphone indicator icon appears in the top bar and is shown for the duration of the recording.
The disappearance of the microphone icon from the top bar indicates that the process is completed and `wsi` or `wrsi` has "blurted" a snippet of text that can be pasted with the middle mouse button. (Note that on slower systems there may be a slight delay after the microphone icon disappears and before the text reaches the clipboard due to the time needed for transcription. On my computer it is less than 300 ms for an average paragraph of spoken text).

If one fancies keyboard-only operation and wants to paste with the standard `CTRL+V` for example, then they can use the `wrsi` script (instead of `wsi`), which uses the standard clipboard under X11 and Wayland (not the PRIMARY sellection).
In this case, it is advisable to relegate the speech recording to hotkeys triggered with the right hand. For example I have setup the "+" and "Insert" keys on the numeric keypad since I do not use it.
Then pasting happens very fast with the left hand. Here is a demostration video:

### SYSTEM SETUP

#### PREREQUISITES:
- zsh or bash command line shell installation on a Linux system running GNOME.   
- working [whisper.cpp installation](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) or a listening whisper.cpp server on your LAN (see network-transcription [section](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/BlahST/#network-transcription) below)
- The orchestrator tool **wsi**,[**wrsi**,**netwrsi**] from this repository **must be placed in your $HOME/.local/bin/ folder or elsewhere in your $PATH** (The installation script `install-wrsi` handles most of these).  
- recent versions of 'sox', 'xsel' or 'wl-copy'  command-line tools from your system's repositories.
-  A working microphone

#### "INSTALLATION"

##### USING THE INSTALLATION SCRIPT
Run the script **install-wrsi** from the folder of the cloned repository and follow the prompts. It will move the scripts and make them executable, create a link to whisper.cpp `main` executable, set the environemt and set a default whisper.cpp model, check for dependencies and request their installation if missing, etc.
The installation script also handles setup for network transcription, but the IP and port for the whisper.cpp server must be set manually in `netwrsi`
Run the scripts (`wsi`,`wrsi` or `netwrsi`) directly from the command line first to verify their proper operation. Later those will be invoked only with [hotkeys](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/BlahST/#gui-setup-of-hotkeys) for speed and convenience.

##### MANUAL INSTALLATION

*(Assuming whisper.cpp is installed and the "main" executable compiled with 'make' in the cloned whisper.cpp repo. See Prerequisites section)*
* Place the scripts **wsi**, **wrsi** and **netwrsi** in $HOME/.local/bin/
* Make them executable
  ```
  cd $HOME/.local/bin; chmod +x wsi wrsi netwrsi
  ```
* Run once from the command line to let the script(s) check for required dependencies
* If using local whisper.cpp, create a symbolic link (the code expects 'transcribe' in your $PATH) to the compiled "main" executable in the whisper.cpp directory.
  For example, create it in your `$HOME/.local/bin/` (part of your $PATH) with 
```
ln -s /full/path/to/whisper.cpp/main $HOME/.local/bin/transcribe
```
If transcribe is not in your $PATH, either edit the call to it in **wsi** to include the absolute path, or add its location to the $PATH variable. Otherwise the script will fail.

###### Network transcription
This would be useful for Linux systems that need speech-to-text functionality but do not have the power to transcribe speech efficiently. 
Speech is recorded on the local machine and sent over to a running instance of whisper.cpp [server](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/examples/server), typically on the local network.

To make this tool work in network transcription mode, one should use (and [setup hotkeys](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/BlahST/#gui-setup-of-hotkeys) for) the **netwrsi** script (can be set up alongside the other two).
* **netwrsi** can be found in this repository and should also be placed in $HOME/.local/bin. (also done from the installation script)
* The IP and port number for the server should be entered in the configuration block of `netwrsi`.
* The `netwrsi` script will check that a running server is present at the specified IP and complain if not found. To properly set up the server, please, look at its [documentation](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/examples/server)

Please, run the script from the command line first to check for its dependencies and have them installed.
 
#### CONFIGURATION
##### For manual installation only:
Inside the **wsi** (or **wrsi**) script, near the begining, there is a clearly marked section, named **"USER CONFIGURATION BLOCK"**, where all the user-configurable variables (described in the following section) have been collected. 
Most can be left as is but the important one is the location of the whisper.cpp model file that you would like to use during transcription (or the IP and port number for the whisper.cpp server in **netwrsi**)

##### GUI SETUP OF HOTKEYS 
( to start and stop speech input, for both manual and automatic installation)
##### CASE 1: GNOME
###### Hotkey to start recording of speech
* Open your GNOME system settings and find "Keyboard".
* Under "Keyboard shortcuts", "View and customize shortcuts"
* In the new window, scroll down to "Custom Shortcuts" and press it.
* Press "+" to add a new shortcut and give it a name: "Start recording speech"
* In the "Command" field type `/home/yourusername/.local/bin/wsi`
* Then press "Set Shortcut" and select a (unused) key combination. For example CTRL+ALT+a
* Click Add and you are done. 

The **wsi** (**wrsi**) script has a silence detection filter in the call to sox (rec) and would stop recording (in the best case) on 2 seconds of silence.
In addition, if one does not want wait or has issues with the silence detection threshold:

###### Manual speech recording interuption
For those who want to be able to interupt the recording manually with a key combination, in the spirit of great hacks, we are going to use the system built-in features:
* Open your GNOME system settings and find "Keyboard".
* Under "Keyboard shortcuts", "View and customize shortcuts"
* In the new window, scroll down to "Custom Shortcuts" and press it.
* Press "+" to add a new shortcut and give it a name: "Blurt it already!"
* In the "Command" field type `pkill --signal 2 rec`
* Then press "Set Shortcut" and select a (unused) key combination. For example CTRL+ALT+x
* Click Add and you are done.
  
That Simple.  Just make sure that the new key binding has not been set-up already for something else.
Now when the script is recording speech, it can be stopped with the new key combo and transcription will start immediatelly.

##### CASE 2: XFCE4
* Open the Xfce4 Settings Manager.
* Navigate to Keyboard â†’ Application Shortcuts.
* Click on the Add button to create a new shortcut.
* Enter the name of the shortcut and the command e.g. `/home/yourusername/.local/bin/wsi` or `pkill --signal 2 rec`.
* Press the keys you wish to assign to the shortcut.
* Click OK to save the shortcut.
 The hotkey to stop speech recording should be done similarly.
 
##### CASE 3: KDE (Plasma)
* Open the System Settings application.
* Navigate to Shortcuts and then Custom Shortcuts.
* Click on Edit and then New to create a new group for your shortcuts if needed.
* Under the newly created group, click on New again and select Global Shortcut -> Command/URL.
* Give your new shortcut a name.
* Choose the desired shortcut key combination by clicking on the button next to "None" and pressing the keys you want to assign to the shortcut.
* In the Trigger tab, specify the command to be executed when the shortcut is triggered. e.g. `/home/yourusername/.local/bin/wsi`
* Ensure that the Enabled checkbox is checked to activate the shortcut.
* Apply the changes by clicking Apply or OK.
The hotkey to stop speech recording should be done similarly.
 
Please, note that there may be slight variations in these steps depending on the version installed on your system.
For many other environements, such as Mate, Cinnamon, LXQt, Deepin, etc. the steps should be somewhat simmilar to the examples above.
Please, consult the documentation for your systems desktop environment.

##### Summary
* On the press of a hotkey combo, the `wsi` script will record speech (stopped with a hotkey or by silence detection), use a local copy of whisper.cpp and send the transcribed text to the PRIMARY selection under, either X11 or Wayland.
Then all one has to do is paste it with the middle mouse button anywhere they want. (For people holding the mouse with their right hand, speech recording hotkeys for the left hand would make sense here) 

* If using **wrsi** (the approaches can coexist, just set up different set of hotkeys), the transcribed text is sent to the clipboard (not PRIMARY selection) under, either X11 or Wayland.
Then pasting it happens with the `CTRL+V` (`CTRL+SHIFT+V` for GNOME terminal) or `SHIFT+INSert` keys as usual. (For mopst people, right-hand hotkeys would work well.)

* If transcribing over the network with **netwrsi** (selected with a hotkey of its own), the script will attempt to send the recorded audio to a running, properly set whisper.cpp server on a dedicated more capable machine.
  It will then collect the textual response and format it for pasting with the `CTRL+V` (`CTRL+SHIFT+V` for GNOME terminal) or `SHIFT+INSert` keys (by default, but it could be configured to use the middle mouse button).
