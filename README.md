# cliblurt
Input text from speech anywhere with GNOME keyboard shortcuts

The inspiration for this little tool came from Blurt. 
A simple GNOME extension that can input text from speech into any window with an ediatble text field.
If you liked Blurt for its power vs simplicity ratio, you will love this.
The work is done by the *wsi* script, which is a toned down version of *notewhispers*.
The actuall heavy lifting is executed by whisper.cpp which must be precompiled on your Linux system.

The idea here is to not even write an extension like blurt. Just use a pair of hotkeys to start and stop recording from the microphone and send the recorded speech to whisper.cpp

### Setup
Please, read the setup for [blurt](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/blurt/) up to the point of downloading the GNOME extension (which we do not need here).
